<h2>Labeling source code changes and comments</h2>

<p>First of all, we thank you for your participation in this project.</p>

<p>Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to answer several questions about the consistency of changes in <strong>Java
    functions</strong> and their corresponding <strong>comments</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the results of
    this task, the best tolokers will gain access to more complicated code-labeling tasks with higher per-task
    payment.</p>


<!--<h2>Comment Structure</h2>-->

<!--<p>We divide each JavaDoc comment into four parts: <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>@param</strong>, <strong>@return</strong>, and <strong>@throws</strong>.</p>-->

<!--<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hB9W48X/Screenshot-2021-12-01-at-14-01-06.png" width="800">-->


<!--<ul>-->
<!--    <li><p>The <strong>Summary</strong> part usually consists of several sentences at the beginning of a comment. This-->
<!--        part describes the general behavior of the function. We can assume that the Summary is any comment that does not belong to one of the following parts.</p></li>-->
<!--    <li><p>The <strong>@param</strong> part consists of descriptions of the function parameters, with each parameter-->
<!--        described after the @param tag.</p></li>-->
<!--    <li><p>The <strong>@return</strong> part goes after the @return tag in the comment and describes the return value.-->
<!--    </p></li>-->
<!--    <li><p>The <strong>@throws</strong> part follows after @throws or @exception tags and describes an exception that-->
<!--        may be thrown from this method. </p></li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--<p>The comment does not necessarily contain all four parts. For example, it can only consist of @return and-->
<!--    @param parts, this is normal.</p>-->

<h2><strong>Labeling example</strong></h2>

<p>The examples provided for the annotation will look
    like this:</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at this
    example.


    Before the code change, the method removed an existing file (line 4)<strong>or</strong> created a new file (line 7).

    After the code change, the method removes an existing file (line 4) <strong>and</strong> creates a new file (line 8).

    <br>
    However, the method's comment does not capture this change. It still uses <strong>or</strong> instead of <strong>and</strong>. </p>
For this reason, we select the following options:

<ul>
    <li>Comment <strong> must be changed</strong></li>
    <li><p> The reason is <strong>Logic changed</strong></p></li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Careful markup</strong></h2>

<p>Before starting the markup, we ask you to read the detailed meaning of all the available answers.</p>

<p>In the following two sections we will provide a detailed explanation for "Can stay unchanged" options.</p>

<h4>External change</h4>

<p>Some external function call or class usage is changed in the code. Logic of the method is not changed.</p>

<p>Developers change an interface of the create function for RandomSource variables. This change is
    exclusively external for the testSharedStateSample method. It does not change any code logic or local variables. That's why <strong>"Yes"</strong> should be chosen in this question. </p>



<h4>Renaming without introducing inconsistency</h4>

<p>Renaming of a variable or method's renaming, which does not affect the comment.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/F04zcHQ/Screenshot-2022-03-05-at-14-18-52.png" width="700">

<p>You may notice that the method's name is changed in this example. However, the comment shouldn't be changed, because it does not mention renamed tokens explicitly.
</p>


<h2>Quality control</h2>

<p>We expect you to be careful about the markup and will use test assignments to validate it for correctness.</p>
