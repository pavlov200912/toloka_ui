<h2>Labeling source code changes and comments</h2>
<p>First of all, we thank you for your participation in this project.</p>

<p>Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to answer several questions about consistency of changes in <strong>Java functions</strong> and corresponding <strong>comments</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the results on
    this task, the best tolokers will gain access to more complicated code-labelling tasks with higher per-task
    payment.</p>

<h2>Comment Structure</h2>

<p>We divide each JavaDoc comment into four parts: <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>@param</strong>, <strong>@return</strong>, and <strong>@throws</strong>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <strong>Summary</strong> part usually consists of several sentences at the beginning of a comment. This
        part describes the general behavior of the function. We can assume that the Summary is any comment that does not belong to one of the following parts.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@param</strong> part consists of descriptions of the function parameters, with each parameter
        described after the @param tag.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@return</strong> part goes after the @return tag in the comment and describes the return value.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@throws</strong> part follows after @throws or @exception tags and describes an exception that
        may be thrown from this method. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The comment does not necessarily contain all four parts. For example, it can only consist of @return and
    @param parts, this is normal.</p>

<h2>Labelling example</h2>

<p>The examples provided for the annotation will look
    like this:</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at this
    example. You may notice that the code changes introduce a new parameter to the method's signature. After the change,
    the method takes 5 parameters instead of 4. However, the corresponding comment still has information about only 4 of
    them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p> Summary part can stay <strong>unchanged</strong>, because the code changes don't affect the logic described
        in the comment. The method still "adds a HostPath volume to the pod-spec".</p></li>
    <li><p> @param part <strong>must be changed</strong>. We have to add a description for the newly introduced
        parameter. </p></li>
    <li><p> @return part is absent. </p></li>
    <li><p> @throws part is also absent. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Careful markup</h2>

<p>Before starting the markup, we ask you to read all the answer options hidden behind each of the choice points.</p>

<p>For example, for the Summary part there are such options:</p>

<p>Note that there are separate checkboxes for examples that only consist of @since, for examples with renaming, for examples with a code style change, and so on.</p>

<p>We expect you to be careful about the markup and will use test assignments to validate it for correctness.</p>
