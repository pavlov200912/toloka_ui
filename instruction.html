<h2>Labeling source code changes and comments</h2>

<p>First of all, we thank you for your participation in this project.</p>

<p>Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to answer several questions about consistency of changes in <strong>Java code</strong> with corresponding <strong>comment</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the result of this task, the best tolokers will be permitted to access more complicated tasks of annotating source code and comments.</p>

<h2>Labeling example</h2>

<p>The examples provided for the annotation will look like this:</p>

<p>Learn more about this example. You may notice that the code changes introduce a new parameter to the method's signature. After the change, the method takes 5 parameters instead of 4. However, the corresponding comment stil have information only about 4 of them.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p> To make the code and comment consistent with each other, we need to add <tt>@param</tt> with description of newly added parameter to the comment.  Therefore, response to the question  <strong>"Should comment be changed?"</strong> is <strong>"Yes"</strong>.</p></li>
    <li><p>The next question is <strong>"Must the comment be completely overwritten?"</strong> and the answer is <strong>"No"</strong>. The code changes don't make the comment incorrect completely, there is only a need to update it by providing information about a new parameter.</p></li>
    <li><p>The next question is <strong>"Should something be changed in @param, @return or @throws part of the comment?"</strong>. The answer is <strong>"Yes"</strong>, we because we need to add a new <tt>@param</tt> to the code comment.</p></li>
    <li><p>Finally, we have to choose only <strong>Param</strong> checkbox, because other options Return and Throws aren't changed in the code. </p></li>
</ul>
