<h2>Labeling source code changes and comments</h2>

<p>First of all, we thank you for your participation in this project.</p>

<p>Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to answer several questions about <strong>Java code changes</strong> and <strong>comment</strong> in order to classify whether comment is consistent with shown code changes.</p>

<p>Depending on the result of this task, the best tolokers will be permitted to access more complicated tasks of annotating source code and comments.</p>

<h2>Labeling example</h2>

<p>The examples provided for the annotation will look like this:</p>

<p>Learn more about this example. You may notice that the code changes add a parameter to the function. After the change, the function takes 5 parameters.
    Although the commentary describes only 4 of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> We have to add one <tt>@param</tt> description to the comment, therefore, to the question <strong>"Should comment be changed?"</strong> we answered <strong>"Yes"</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Next question is <strong>"The comment must be completely overwritten?"</strong> and the answer is <strong>"No"</strong>, because changes in code only concern <tt>@param</tt> part of the comment. We don't have to replace first sentence of the comment or @param part about first four params. </p></li>
    <li><p>After that, we are asked <strong>"Should something be changed in @param @return or @throws?"</strong>. The answer is <strong>"Yes"</strong>, we want to change <tt>@param</tt>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Finally, we have to choose only <strong>Param</strong> checkbox, because other options Return and Throws aren't changed in the code. </p></li>
</ul>
