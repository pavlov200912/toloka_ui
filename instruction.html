<h2>Labeling source code changes and comments</h2>

<p>First of all, we thank you for your participation in this project.</p>

<p>Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to answer several questions about consistency of changes in <strong>Java code</strong> with corresponding <strong>comment</strong>.</p>

<p>Depending on the result of this task, the best tolokers will be permitted to access more complicated tasks of annotating source code and comments.</p>

<h2>Comment Structure</h2>

<p>We divide each JavaDoc comment into four parts: <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>@param</strong>, <strong>@return</strong>, and <strong>@throws</strong>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>The <strong>Summary</strong> part usually consists of several sentences at the beginning of a comment. This part describes the general behavior of the function.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@param</strong> part consists of a description of the function parameters, each parameter is described after the @param tag.</p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@return</strong> part goes after the @return tag in the comment and describes the return value. </p></li>
    <li><p>The <strong>@throws</strong> part follows after @throws or @exception tags and describes an exception that may be thrown from this method. </p></li>
</ul>


<p>The comment does not necessarily contain all four parts. For example, it can only consist of @return and @param parts, this is normal.</p>

<h2>Labeling example</h2>

<p>The examples provided for the annotation will look like this:</p>

<p>Learn more about this example. You may notice that the code changes introduce a new parameter to the method's signature. After the change, the method takes 5 parameters instead of 4. However, the corresponding comment still has information about only 4 of them.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p> Summary part can stay <strong>unchanged</strong>, because the code changes don't affect logic described in the comment.
        This method still "adds a HostPath volume to the pod-spec".</p></li>
    <li><p> @param part <strong>must be changed</strong>. We have to add a description for the newly introduced parameter. </p></li>
    <li><p> @return part is absent. </p></li>
    <li><p> @throws part is also absent. </p></li>
</ul>
